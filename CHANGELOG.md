# Changelog

All notable changes to GutenbergKG are documented here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

---

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`gutenkg snapshot prune`** — new subcommand that removes vestigial snapshots carrying
  no new metric information. Cleans three categories: metric-duplicates (interior snapshots
  with identical metrics), broken entries (manifest entries whose JSON file is missing), and
  orphaned files (JSON files on disk not referenced by the manifest). Oldest (baseline) and
  newest (latest) snapshots are always kept. `--dry-run` reports what would be removed
  without deleting anything.

- **`gutenkg re-register`** — new CLI command (`cmd_reregister.py` + `run_reregister()` in
  `ingest.py`) that re-registers all built books in the KGRAG registry with the correct
  `kind=gutenberg` without rebuilding DocKGs. Idempotent and safe to run on any machine,
  including fresh clones where the registry is empty. Accepts `--genre`, `--dry-run`, and
  `--registry` flags. Skips books that are already correctly tagged and books with no built
  `.dockg/graph.sqlite`.

### Changed

- **`gutenkg snapshot`** — rewritten to use `GutenbergSnapshotManager` (backed by
  `kg_utils.snapshots.SnapshotManager`). Snapshots are now keyed by git tree hash and
  stored alongside a `manifest.json` index with per-entry deltas vs. previous and baseline.
  Subcommands updated: `save` gains `--force` and `--json`; `list` gains `--branch`,
  `--limit`, and `--json`; `show` is key-addressable (defaults to latest); `diff` accepts
  explicit keys or auto-selects last two, with `--json` output.

- **`tests/test_cmd_snapshot.py`** — fully rewritten for the new `GutenbergSnapshotManager`
  API (37 tests). Covers help text, `list`/`show`/`diff`/`prune`/`save` CLI paths, error
  cases, JSON output, round-trip save→list and save→show flows. Uses a `fake_registry`
  fixture (in-memory SQLite) for `save` tests; all others use a manifest-writing helper so
  no live registry is required.

### Fixed

- **`gutenkg snapshot diff` delta display** — all metrics showed `(+0)` because `_line()`
  looked up the computed delta using `total_books`/`total_nodes` keys while
  `_compute_delta_from_metrics` stores them as `books`/`nodes`. Fixed by computing the
  delta directly as `mb − ma` from the already-fetched metric values, eliminating any
  dependency on delta dict key names.

- **`ingest.py` `register_book`** — changed `KGKind.from_str("doc")` to `KGKind.GUTENBERG`
  so all new ingest runs register books with the correct kind. Previously all 203 Gutenberg
  books were registered as `kind=doc` instead of `kind=gutenberg`.

---

## [1.2.2] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- **`runpod/`** — RunPod serverless deployment package for GutenbergKG semantic
  search. Includes `handler.py` (RunPod serverless handler with KGRAG
  orchestration), `Dockerfile` (bakes `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` into the image
  for cold-start-free embedding), `build_image.sh` (builds local wheels +
  Docker image), `build_kg.py` (remote index builder for RunPod dev pods),
  `push_indices.sh` (rsyncs local indices to Network Volume), `test_local.py`
  (local smoke test without Docker), and `test_input.json` (RunPod local worker
  test payload).

- **`.runpod/hub.json`** — RunPod Hub endpoint metadata for the GutenbergKG
  semantic search worker (name, description, env var schema, resource config).

- **`.runpod/tests.json`** — RunPod Hub automated test cases (stoic virtue,
  redemption in literature, nature of justice).

- **`reports/ingest_2026-05-15_234014.md`** — full ingest report from the
  384-dim index rebuild across all 203 Gutenberg books.

### Changed

- **`ingest.py` — embedder surfaced in job summary** — both the terminal box
  and the saved Markdown report now include an `Embedder:` row showing the
  sentence-transformer model used (e.g. `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`). Captured
  from the first genre's shared embedder; `print_summary` and `save_summary`
  accept a new optional `embed_model` parameter.

- **`pyproject.toml`** — pinned `transformers>=5.8.1` to resolve
  `huggingface-hub 1.x` compatibility; `transformers 5.8.0` incorrectly
  rejected `huggingface-hub>=1.0` at import time.

---

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-13

### Changed

- **`gutenkg rebuild-indices`** — rewritten to delegate to `ingest.run_ingest()`
  instead of shelling out to `dockg build`. Now honours the same `IngestOptions`
  pipeline as `gutenkg ingest`, adds `--force-build` flag, and skips books whose
  `.dockg/` already exists unless `--force-build` is passed. Removes the old
  `subprocess` + manual loop implementation (~60 lines → ~10 lines).

- **`.claude/skills/gutenkg/`** — Claude Code skill updated to v1.2.1 coverage:
  adds `ia` command group (download/catalog/search/survey), `snapshot` subcommands,
  `status`, `viz3d`, `viz-timeline`, `list-genres`, and `rebuild-indices --force-build`
  to both SKILL.md and references/commands.md. Standard batch workflow now includes
  `snapshot save` step. IA catalog file format documented. Pitfalls section expanded.

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- **`src/gutenberg_kg/corpus.py`** — new library module that extracts all
  corpus data logic from the CLI layer into a path-parameterised public API.
  Provides `collect_genre_stats`, `corpus_status`, `snapshot_build`,
  `snapshot_save`, `snapshot_list`, `snapshot_show`, `snapshot_diff`, plus
  internal helpers `_sqlite_counts`, `_count_authors`, `_git_info`, and the
  canonical `GENRE_LABELS` mapping. All functions accept explicit path
  arguments so they can be called from CLI, tests, or adapter code without
  depending on package-level constants.

- **`gutenkg viz-timeline`** — interactive Plotly corpus growth chart built
  from saved snapshots. Two modes via `--type`:
  - `2d` (default): 2×2 subplot grid — Books / Authors / Nodes / Edges over
    time, with hover tooltips showing version and commit.
  - `3d`: normalized multi-metric scatter stacked by metric; all four series
    rendered in one scene for cross-metric trend comparison.
  Requires the new `viz` extra (`pip install gutenberg-kg[viz]`). Emits an
  ASCII growth summary table before showing the chart.

- **`viz` optional-dependency group** — `plotly>=5.0.0` for the `viz-timeline`
  command. Install with `pip install -e ".[viz]"` or
  `poetry install --extras "viz"`. Included in `all`.

### Changed

- **`cmd_status.py` refactored** — delegates all data collection to
  `corpus.corpus_status()`; module now contains only Click command wiring,
  Rich table rendering, and README badge patching. Thin wrapper aliases
  (`_collect_genre_stats`, `_count_book_dirs`, `_genre_corpus_name`,
  `_sqlite_counts`, `_GENRE_LABELS`) kept for test-import compatibility.

- **`cmd_snapshot.py` refactored** — delegates snapshot I/O to
  `corpus.snapshot_save/list/show/diff()`; `_SNAPSHOTS_DIR` renamed to
  `SNAPSHOTS_DIR` (public) so tests can monkeypatch it. Thin wrappers
  (`_snapshot_filename`, `_load_snapshot`, `_list_snapshots`) retained for
  test-import compatibility.

- **`pyproject.toml`** — `all` extra reorganized with `# dev / # kgdeps /
  # viz / # viz3d` section comments; `viz` and `viz3d` install lines added
  to the Quick Install header.

### Fixed

- **`tests/test_cmd_status.py` and `tests/test_cmd_snapshot.py` import
  errors** — after the corpus refactor the tests could not import private
  helpers (`_collect_genre_stats`, `_list_snapshots`, etc.) that had moved
  to `corpus.py`. Re-exposed as thin wrappers in the respective CLI modules;
  both test files now collect and pass cleanly (83 tests, 0 failures).

- **`gutenkg status`** — new CLI command that reads live corpus statistics
  directly from the KGRAG registry SQLite without requiring a rebuild.
  Displays a Rich table (with plain-text fallback) of per-genre book,
  node, and edge counts. Options: `--json` (machine-readable output),
  `--update-readme` (patches corpus/node/edge badge URLs in `README.md`
  automatically), `--registry` (override registry path).

- **`gutenkg snapshot` subcommand group** — point-in-time corpus metrics
  snapshots stored in `corpus/.snapshots/` (gitignored). Four subcommands:
  - `snapshot save` — capture current stats; writes timestamped JSON keyed
    by version, branch, and commit. `--output` overrides path; `--print`
    also emits JSON to stdout.
  - `snapshot list` — tabular listing of all saved snapshots.
  - `snapshot show [SNAPSHOT]` — print full JSON for a snapshot (defaults
    to the most recent); accepts a timestamp prefix for selection.
  - `snapshot diff [A] [B]` — compare two snapshots showing Δ books/nodes/
    edges at the total and per-genre level (defaults to last two).

- **`tests/test_cmd_status.py`** — 42 tests covering all pure helpers
  (`_genre_corpus_name`, `_count_book_dirs`, `_sqlite_counts`,
  `_fmt_badge_nodes`, `_update_readme_badges`, `_collect_genre_stats`) and
  CLI integration (help, missing registry, `--json` payload shape and
  totals, author count, `--update-readme` side effect).

- **`tests/test_cmd_snapshot.py`** — 41 tests covering all pure helpers
  (`_snapshot_filename`, `_load_snapshot`, `_list_snapshots`) and CLI
  integration (all four subcommands, error paths, round-trip save→list
  and save→diff flows). Uses `monkeypatch` to redirect `SNAPSHOTS_DIR`
  and `CORPUS_ROOT` to `tmp_path` for isolation.

- **`corpus/.snapshots/` gitignored** — snapshot files live alongside
  `.dockg/` directories but are excluded from version control.

### Changed

- **Corpus stats updated: 178 → 181 books** — README.md badges, prose
  counts, and `docs/CORPUS.md` header updated; per-genre node/edge counts
  refreshed (878,403 nodes, 17,564,366 edges after re-index).

### Fixed

- **Circular import in `cmd_snapshot.py`** — `_collect_genre_stats` was
  imported from `cmd_status` at module level; `main.py` imports both
  modules at startup, creating a load-order cycle. Fixed by lazily
  importing `_collect_genre_stats` inside `_build_snapshot()` and
  defining `_REGISTRY_DEFAULT` locally in `cmd_snapshot.py`.

- **Unused `rich.text.Text` import removed** from `cmd_status.py`
  `_print_rich_table()` (flagged by ruff F401).

- **Corpus expanded to 178 books** — five new Stoic texts added to
  `ancient-classical` and one new Nietzsche work to `philosophy`:
  - *Minor Dialogues, Together With the Dialogue on Clemency* — Seneca
    (Stewart trans.; includes *Of Providence*, *Of Constancy*, *Of Anger*,
    *Of Clemency*)
  - *The Golden Sayings of Epictetus, with the Hymn of Cleanthes* — Epictetus
  - *The Meditations of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus* — Marcus Aurelius
    (Long trans.)
  - *The Teaching of Epictetus* — Epictetus
  - *Thoughts of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus* — Marcus Aurelius
  - *The Twilight of the Idols; or, How to Philosophize with the Hammer.
    The Antichrist* — Friedrich Nietzsche
  - Corpus now at 944,384 nodes and 18,443,197 edges

- **`docs/CORPUS.md`** — dedicated 249-line corpus listing (178 books × 13 genres)
  extracted from `README.md` so the master README stays lean; README now links
  to it.

- **`scripts/provenance_verifier.py`** — mechanized 8-word substring verifier
  for the frontier-model provenance experiment. Takes the first 8 words of each
  quoted passage, normalises case and punctuation, and checks against the
  committed corpus files; produces VERIFIED / HALLUCINATED / UNVERIFIABLE
  verdicts.

- **`HANDOFF.md`** — task handoff document describing the provenance verifier
  work item, input files, and expected output format.

- **`.claude/skills/gutenkg/`** — Claude Code skill definition for the gutenkg
  CLI (`SKILL.md` + `references/commands.md`), enabling AI-assisted corpus
  management and ingest workflows directly in the IDE.

- **New author profiles** — 40+ author metadata files added under
  `corpus/authors/` for newly ingested and back-filled authors (Seneca,
  Epictetus, Aeschylus, Aristophanes, Aristotle, Herodotus, Thucydides,
  Ovid, Plutarch, Boethius, Kant, Rousseau, Descartes, Mill, Emerson,
  Wollstonecraft, and more).

- **`viz3d.py` — `GENRE_PALETTE`** — 10-color dark-background-friendly,
  colour-blind-safe genre palette for tree trunk colouring.

- **`viz3d.py` — `_glyph_proto()`** — prototype mesh factory for
  `pv.PolyData.glyph()` batch rendering; replaces the per-node
  `_make_node_mesh()` loop in the main render path.

- **`viz3d.py` — `ForestLayout.branch_lines`** — list of `(axis_pt, tip_pt)`
  tuples populated during `compute()`; drawn as a single flat numpy polydata
  with zero per-line Python objects.

- **`viz3d.py` — `ForestLayout.trunk_genres` / `genre_color_map`** — per-trunk
  genre label and genre→hex-colour mapping for the merged-trunk draw call.

- **`viz3d.py` — `ForestLayout.max_trunk_height`** — cap (default 45 units) so
  no single large book dominates the grove silhouette.

- **Two new ingest reports** — `reports/ingest_2026-05-07_014830.md` and
  `reports/ingest_2026-05-07_020626.md` capturing the Stoic corpus expansion
  runs.

### Changed

- **`gutenkg rebuild-lancedb` → `gutenkg rebuild-indices`** — command and all
  associated help text renamed to a technology-neutral term; `cmd_rebuild.py`
  function renamed from `rebuild_lancedb` to `rebuild_indices`.  Docs and tests
  updated accordingly.

- **`viz3d.py` — ForestLayout grove radii doubled** — `grove_inner_radius`
  default 40 → 80, `grove_outer_radius` 120 → 240; `trunk_scale` 6 → 4.  Gives
  178-book groves room to breathe without overlap.

- **`viz3d.py` — section nodes spiral up trunk (golden-angle branching)**
  — replaces the Fibonacci upper-hemisphere approach: sections are placed along
  the trunk height at a golden-angle offset, producing a real tree branching
  pattern. Trunk-axis → section-tip lines are recorded as `branch_lines` and
  drawn as a single line mesh.

- **`viz3d.py` — glyph rendering replaces per-node mesh loop** — node
  rendering is now O(kinds) Python work rather than O(nodes): positions are
  bucketed per kind, then `pv.PolyData.glyph()` creates one merged mesh per
  kind in a single VTK draw call.  Eliminates the progress-bar loop and
  associated `QApplication.processEvents()` calls during mesh building.

- **`viz3d.py` — genre-colored trunks via merged mesh + `ListedColormap`**
  — all trunk cylinders are merged into a single `pv.PolyData` with a
  `genre_idx` cell scalar; a `ListedColormap` maps indices to genre colours.
  Result: one `add_mesh` call for all trunks regardless of genre count.

- **`viz3d.py` — chunk canopy uses upper-hemisphere cone** — orphan chunks and
  section-child chunks are now placed in the upper hemisphere above their parent
  Z level; reflected if insufficient upper-hemisphere points are available from
  the Fibonacci sample.

- **`viz3d.py` — CONTAINS edges hidden by default** — `show_contains` param
  default changed `True` → `False`; the control panel checkbox initialised
  accordingly. Reduces visual noise on first load.

- **`viz3d.py` — ground plane enlarged** — `i_size` / `j_size` 600 → 1000 to
  match the doubled grove radii.

- **`viz3d.py` — pick handler improved** — trunk clicks navigate to the nearest
  document node (showing book info); status bar messages added for every pick
  outcome; `picker.SetPickFromList(0)` set to enable actor-list picking.

- **`README.md`** — corpus stats updated (175 → 178 books, 850K → 944K nodes,
  16.9M → 18.4M edges); corpus book listing moved to `docs/CORPUS.md`; `kgrag
  synthesize` example added to the query section; "Audel Electric (IA)" genre
  renamed to "Technical Reference (IA)"; DOI badge switched to canonical
  `zenodo.org/badge/doi/` form.

- **`docs/CHEATSHEET.md`** — updated for `rebuild-indices` command; `.dockg/`
  layout comment clarified.

- **`docs/DOWNLOAD_PIPELINE.md`** — `.dockg/` layout comments clarified
  (graph.sqlite → "Graph database"; lancedb → "Vector index (gitignored)").

- **Multiple author profiles updated** — Darwin, Dickens, Dante Alighieri,
  Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, H.G. Wells, Thoreau,
  Jack London, Jules Verne, Tolstoy, Plato, Victor Hugo, Shakespeare author
  files updated to reflect new works or corrected metadata.

### Fixed

- **`tests/test_cli.py`** — `test_rebuild_lancedb_help` renamed to
  `test_rebuild_indices_help`; command string updated from `rebuild-lancedb`
  to `rebuild-indices` throughout.

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- **`src/gutenberg_kg/ingest.py` — `run_ingest()` orchestrator** — centralised
  genre-loop, corpus setup, registry management, and summary printing into a
  single public function. `cmd_ingest.py` now calls `ig.run_ingest()` in three
  lines instead of duplicating ~80 lines of logic.

- **`gutenkg download search` — `--subject` and `--language` options** — two
  arguments present in the old argparse layer were missing from the Click CLI.
  Added to `cmd_download.py` and wired through to `gutenberg.run_search()`.

- **Test suite** — four new test modules covering the full library API:
  - `tests/test_gutenberg.py` — 17 tests (metadata fetch, boilerplate strip,
    heading detection, `text_to_markdown`, slugify, idempotence, catalog parsing)
  - `tests/test_ia.py` — 19 tests (search, download, `_coerce_str`,
    `find_text_file`, `write_reference`, `fetch_url` retry)
  - `tests/test_ingest.py` — 9 tests (`run_ingest`, `IngestOptions`,
    `GenreSummary`, `ensure_corpus`, `is_sqlite_valid`)
  - `tests/test_genres.py` — 5 tests (registry load/save, `add_genre`,
    `seed_registry`, fallback defaults)

- **`analysis/gutenberg_kg_analysis_20260505.md`** — PyCodeKG structural
  analysis of the post-refactor codebase (1731 nodes, 1411 edges, 15 modules,
  A/100 quality grade, 93% docstring coverage).

### Changed

- **`src/gutenberg_kg/gutenberg.py`** — removed `import argparse`, five
  `cmd_*` adapter functions, `main()`, and the `if __name__` block (~200 lines).
  Module is now a pure download library; entry point is `gutenkg download`.

- **`src/gutenberg_kg/ia.py`** — same treatment as `gutenberg.py`: removed
  argparse layer, `build_parser()`, `main()`, and `if __name__` (~90 lines).
  Entry point is `gutenkg ia`.

- **`src/gutenberg_kg/cli/cmd_ingest.py`** — collapsed from ~140 lines to ~30.
  Removed duplicated genre loop, corpus setup, and summary printing; delegates
  entirely to `ig.run_ingest()`.

- **`src/gutenberg_kg/cli/cmd_ia.py`** — `ia download --genre` changed from
  `required=True` to `default=None` to match what `ia.download_book()` already
  accepted.

- **Docs updated** — `README.md`, `CHEATSHEET.md`, and `DOWNLOAD_PIPELINE.md`
  updated to remove all script-equivalent blocks and reflect the CLI-only
  interface.

### Removed

- **`scripts/download_gutenberg.py`** — thin wrapper around the old argparse
  `gutenberg.main()`; superseded by `gutenkg download`.
- **`scripts/download_ia.py`** — thin wrapper around `ia.main()`; superseded
  by `gutenkg ia`.
- **`scripts/ingest.py`** — was already broken (called `ingest.main()` which
  never existed); superseded by `gutenkg ingest`.
- **`scripts/rebuild_lancedb.sh`** — covered by `gutenkg rebuild-lancedb`.
- **`scripts/push.sh`** — covered by `gutenkg ingest --push`; contained a
  hardcoded genre list that would have drifted from `corpus/genres.json`.

### Added (corpus & genre registry)

- **Aristophanes** added to the `ancient-classical` genre — three new texts:
  - *The Frogs* (Gutenberg #7998, 77.8 KB standalone)
  - *The Eleven Comedies, Volume 1* (Gutenberg #8688, 499.6 KB — includes *The Wasps*, *The Acharnians*, *The Knights*, *The Clouds*, *Peace*, *The Birds*)
  - *The Eleven Comedies, Volume 2* (Gutenberg #8689, 585.6 KB — includes *Lysistrata*, *Thesmophoriazusae*, *The Frogs* alt. translation, *Ecclesiazusae*, *Plutus*)
  - Ingested as three DocKGs: 11,105 combined nodes, 151,966 combined edges
  - `ancient-classical` corpus now at 12 books, 63,000 nodes, 798,131 edges

- **`audel-electric` genre** — three Audel electric library volumes downloaded
  from Internet Archive and ingested as DocKGs:
  - *Audels Electric Library Vol 1* (IA: `audels-electric-library-vol-1`, 1929) — Fundamental Principles and Rules of Electricity, Magnetism, Armature Winding
  - *Audels Electric Library Vol 2* (IA: `audels-electric-library-vol-2`, 1929) — Dynamos, DC Motors, Construction, Installation, Maintenance
  - *Audels New Electric Library Vol VIII* (IA: `audelsnewelectri008004mbp`, 1962)
  - Ingested: 22,922 nodes, 168,745 edges across 3 books in 44.8s

- **`src/gutenberg_kg/genres.py`** — centralized genre registry backed by
  `corpus/genres.json`. Loads the JSON at import time with built-in defaults as
  fallback; exposes `GUTENBERG_GENRES`, `IA_GENRES`, and `ALL_GENRES`. Provides
  `seed_registry()` and `add_genre()` helpers consumed by the CLI.

- **`gutenkg genres` command group** (`src/gutenberg_kg/cli/cmd_genres.py`) —
  manage the genre registry without editing code:
  - `gutenkg genres init` — seed `corpus/genres.json` from built-in defaults
    (`--force` to overwrite)
  - `gutenkg genres list` — print all registered genres grouped by source
  - `gutenkg genres add <name> --source gutenberg|ia` — append a genre to the
    registry (auto-inits the file if absent)

- **`corpus/genres.json`** — committed registry file seeded with all current
  genres; now the single file to edit when adding a genre.

### Changed

- **Genre lists decoupled from module constants** — `gutenberg.py`, `ia.py`,
  `ingest.py`, and `cli/options.py` all previously contained their own hardcoded
  genre lists (diverging over time). Each now imports from `genres.py`.

- **Documentation updated** — `CHEATSHEET.md`, `README.md`, and
  `DOWNLOAD_PIPELINE.md` updated to document the `gutenkg genres` workflow,
  the `corpus/genres.json` registry, and the new file-layout entries.

### Fixed

- **Internet Archive search API** — `mediatype=texts` is no longer accepted as a
  standalone query parameter by the IA Solr API. Moved it into the Solr query
  string as `AND mediatype:texts`; searches now return results correctly.

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- **Epictetus** added to the `ancient-classical` genre — *A Selection from the
  Discourses of Epictetus with the Encheiridion* (Gutenberg #10661). Brings the
  Stoic shelf alongside Marcus Aurelius's *Meditations* to two works.

### Changed

- **Full corpus re-indexed** with the new BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 embedder.
  Updated corpus stats: **79 books, 448,139 nodes, 4,836,993 edges** (was
  78 books, 445,486 nodes, 4,525,716 edges).
- **Bumped DocKG dependency to 0.13.0** for the bounded SIMILAR_TO graph.
  See "Fixed" below.

### Fixed

- **SIMILAR_TO edge explosion** — under the new embedder, the previous
  threshold-only logic in DocKG produced ~12.4M edges (up from 4.5M) due to
  formulaic prose corpora (Burroughs, Lovecraft, long Russian novels) saturating
  the 0.85 cosine threshold. Patched DocKG to enforce a per-chunk top-k cap
  (default k=5) on SIMILAR_TO edges; corpus now sits at 4.84M edges with bounded
  out-degree, signal-rich similarity links, and ~14% faster ingest. The fix
  required:
  - Implementing the documented-but-dead `similar_k` parameter in
    `doc_kg/index.py:_discover_similar_edges` (was previously labelled
    "unused — kept for API compatibility")
  - Exposing `--similar-k` and `--similar-threshold` flags on `dockg build`
  - Canonicalizing edges to `(min(src,dst), max(src,dst))` so the SQLite
    `(src, rel, dst)` PRIMARY KEY dedupes cross-batch under per-row top-k

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- **Brand assets** — `assets/gutenberg_logo.png` (RGBA master with real transparency),
  `assets/gutenberg_logo.svg` (true vector via vtracer), and size variants:
  `assets/logos/logo_{32,64,128,256,512}.png` for embedding,
  `assets/badges/badge_{20,40,80,200}.png` for shields and inline badges.
- **`scripts/process_logo.py`** — automated logo pipeline. Removes baked-in
  checkerboard background, produces real RGBA alpha with edge-feathered anti-alias,
  generates all logo/badge size variants, and exports SVG via `vtracer`. CLI flags
  for tuning background threshold and feather radius.
- **Test suite** — `tests/test_authors.py`, `tests/test_cli.py`, `tests/test_options.py`,
  `tests/test_version.py` (65 tests, all passing).
- **CI workflow** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs lint + tests on push/PR.
- **GitHub issue templates** — `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` and
  `feature_request.md`.
- **Pre-commit hooks** — `.pre-commit-config.yaml` + `.secrets.baseline` for
  ruff, mypy, and detect-secrets enforcement.
- **`.vscode/settings.json`** — pytest configured against the project venv interpreter.
- **README citation section** — BibTeX + APA blocks; centered logo header; refined
  badges (Python 3.12 | 3.13, Elastic-2.0 code, Public Domain texts, v1.0.0,
  corpus stats, DocKG, KGRAG).
- **Dev dependencies** — `pillow`, `scipy`, `vtracer` added for logo processing.
- **Internet Archive ingestion** — `gutenkg ia` CLI group with `search`, `download`,
  `catalog`, and `survey` subcommands. Fetches books from archive.org, converts OCR
  text to structured Markdown (same pipeline as Gutenberg), and deposits under `corpus/`.
- **`scripts/download_ia.py`** — promoted from `audel_kg/` sub-project into the main
  scripts directory as a first-class source alongside `download_gutenberg.py`.
- **`src/gutenberg_kg/cli/cmd_ia.py`** — Click command group for IA operations.
- **`ALL_IA_GENRES`** in `cli/options.py` — separate genre registry for IA-sourced corpora
  (`audel-electric` initial entry).
- **`HANDOFF_IA.md`** — architecture handoff document for the IA integration work.
- **`gutenkg` CLI** — full Click-based command-line interface (`src/gutenberg_kg/`),
  matching the code_kg/doc_kg package pattern. Entry point: `gutenkg`.
  - `gutenkg ingest` — build DocKG indices, register with KGRAG, push per-genre
  - `gutenkg download book/catalog/search/fetch-genre/survey` — all download operations
  - `gutenkg rebuild-lancedb` — rebuild LanceDB vector indices after clone
  - `gutenkg list-genres` — print all known genres
- **`pyproject.toml`** — Poetry package scaffold; `poetry install` installs `gutenkg`
- **`CHEATSHEET.md`** — full quick-reference for all CLI commands and workflows
- **`scripts/ingest.py`** — major upgrade:
  - Rich box-drawing job summary with per-genre breakdown, node/edge counts, timing
  - Auto-saved Markdown reports to `reports/ingest_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.md`
  - `--push` flag — `git add + commit + push` per genre after ingest
  - `--list-genres` flag
  - `BookResult` and `GenreSummary` dataclasses with timing and graph stats
  - Auto-wipe corrupt/empty `graph.sqlite` before rebuild
  - Wipe `.dockg` before `--force-build` to avoid stale state errors
- **`scripts/download_gutenberg.py`** — major upgrade:
  - `survey` subcommand — scan repo, show `md/ref/kg` status per book by genre
  - `fetch-genre` subcommand — search, confirm, download, report in one step
  - `--genre` flag on `download` and `catalog` — route books into genre subdirectories
  - `--force` flag — re-download even if already present
  - `--dry-run` flag on `download`, `catalog`, `fetch-genre`
  - Idempotent downloads — skip already-present books by default
  - `science-fiction` added to `ALL_GENRES`
- **`scripts/catalogs/science-fiction.txt`** — curated sci-fi catalog (Shelley,
  Wells, Lovecraft, Burroughs, Doyle, Abbott)
- **`scripts/rebuild_lancedb.sh`** — rebuild LanceDB indices after cloning
- **`scripts/push.sh`** — standalone per-genre git push helper (superseded by `--push`)
- **Science-fiction genre** — 14 books ingested (445K nodes, 4.5M edges total corpus)
- **`.gitignore`** — exclude `lancedb/` dirs, `__pycache__`, `.venv/`, build artifacts
- **`.gitattributes`** — LFS tracking scoped to `**/.dockg/graph.sqlite` only
  (removed `.lance`, `.txn`, `.manifest` from LFS — lancedb is now gitignored entirely)
- **`reports/`** — four auto-generated ingest run reports

### Changed

- **`CITATION.cff`** — bumped to version 1.0.0, dated 2026-05-04. Title updated to
  "GutenbergKG: The Knowledge Press"; abstract expanded to cover Internet Archive
  and corpus stats; added `references` block linking DocKG and KGRAG; corrected
  contact email; added explicit `license` field.
- **Re-framed as "The Knowledge Press"** — GutenbergKG is now positioned as a universal
  ingestion engine for digitized text corpora, not a Gutenberg-specific tool. Name is
  unchanged; the metaphor is now explicit: any public domain text source feeds the same
  pipeline.
- **`pyproject.toml`** description updated to "The Knowledge Press -- universal ingestion
  engine for digitized text corpora"; classifier promoted from Alpha to Production/Stable.
- **`gutenkg` CLI help text** updated to reflect the Knowledge Press framing.
- **README.md** — lead paragraph and overview updated for the broader scope; Project
  Gutenberg logo image removed (no affiliation); "Public Domain" badge link changed from
  gutenberg.org to the repo (no implied endorsement).
- **License section** now explicitly states GutenbergKG has no affiliation with or
  endorsement from Project Gutenberg or the Internet Archive.
- LanceDB vector indices are now **local-only** (gitignored). Only `graph.sqlite`
  is committed. Rebuild with `gutenkg rebuild-lancedb` after cloning.
- Git push strategy changed from single monolithic push to **per-genre batched commits**
  via `gutenkg ingest --push`.

### Removed

- **`MANIFESTO.md`** — content consolidated into `README.md` ("Knowledge Press"
  framing).

### Fixed

- `graph.sqlite` corruption crash — `ingest.py` now detects and auto-wipes corrupt
  or empty sqlite files before attempting a build, preventing `sqlite3.DatabaseError`
  on partial builds.
- `--force-build` now wipes `.dockg/` before rebuilding, preventing stale-state errors.
